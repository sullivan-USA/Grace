The 'Implementation' file achieves the below objectives in implementing and using linked lists. An additonal 'test'
file contains tests to verify that the program produced the expected results.

1.	Develop the method 'reverse', which reverses the elements of a linked list in place.  
That is, it does not create new node objects for the values: it reuses the existing ones.  
It does change the next references in the nodes, of course. 
2.	Develop a method called 'insertionSort' that sorts a linked list as follows.
a.	Find the largest value in the list. 
b.	Delete it from its position and insert it at the head of the list
c.	starting from what is now the second element, repeat (a) and (b)
d.	starting from what is now the third element, repeat (a) and (b)
e.	continue until the list is sorted.
3.	Use the 'insertionSort' method to check if two words are anagrams of each other, as follows:
a.	convert each word to a list of letters.
b.	sort the two lists.
c.	check if the two lists are equal.
4.	Develop a method 'asBinary' that takes as input an integer n, and converts n to binary.  
The method should return a linked list with the least significant bit of the binary representation of n at the 
head of the list, and the most significant bit at the tail.  
For example, if n = 13, the binary representation is 1101 (8+4+1), so the list should contain [1, 0 , 1, 1].
5.	Develop a method 'asNumber' that takes as input a list containing 0s and 1s as described in (4), 
and returns the number that the bits represent.  
So asNumber and asBinary are inverses, and you can use this fact in your tests.
6.	Implement the method iterator on linked lists.  
7.	Write a method that takes as input two numbers represented as described in (4), 
and returns a new list containing their sum, represented in the same way.  
Use the asNumber method in the tests to check results for a range of numbers.
